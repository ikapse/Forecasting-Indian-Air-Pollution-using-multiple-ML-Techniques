# Forecasting-using-multiple-ML-Techniques
This is my project completed as part of the deliverables for the 'Predictive Analytics for Business Forecasting' course at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. In this project, we analyse and forecast the Air Pollution data of India using multiple ML techniques.

In this project, the following ML techniques have been implemented

- ARIMA
- SARIMA
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Quantile Regression Neural Network
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- Xtreme Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Please note that the codes used in the repository have been adopted from the codes shared by Prof. Dadabada as part of the 'Predictive Analytics for Business Forecasting' course at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. The codes have been further modified to fit the appropriate use cases.
